What it is
----------

X.A.V.A. is a bar spectrum audio visualizer in a graphical window
 (X11, WINAPI, SDL2).

This program is not intended for scientific use. It's written
 to look responsive and aesthetic when used to visualize music. 


Build requirements
------------------
* [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/)
* [Xlib/X11 dev files](http://x.org/)
* [SDL2 dev files](https://libsdl.org/)
* [ALSA dev files](http://alsa-project.org/)
* [Pulseaudio dev files](http://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/doxygen/)
* [Portaudio dev files](http://www.portaudio.com/)

Only FFTW is actually required for XAVA to compile.

All the requirements can be installed easily in all major distros:

Debian/Raspbian:

    apt-get install libfftw3-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libx11-dev libsdl2-dev libportaudio-dev cmake git

On Ubuntu 20.04+:

    apt-get install libfftw3-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libx11-dev libsdl2-dev libportaudio2 cmake git

Meanwhile on previous Ubuntu releases swap ``libportaudio2`` with ``libportaudio-dev``

ArchLinux:

    pacman -S base-devel fftw alsa-lib iniparser pulseaudio libx11 sdl2 portaudio cmake git

openSUSE:

    zypper install alsa-devel fftw3-devel libX11-devel libSDL2-devel portaudio-devel cmake git

Fedora:

    dnf install alsa-lib-devel fftw3-devel xorg-x11-devel SDL2-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel portaudio-devel cmake git

MSYS2 (Windows):

    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-i686-fftw mingw-w64-i686-SDL2 mingw-w64-i686-portaudio cmake git pkg-config

Brew (macOS):

    brew install portaudio fftw cmake gcc git pkg-config sdl2

Iniparser is also required, but if it is not already installed,
 it will clone the [repository](https://github.com/ndevilla/iniparser).

For compilation you will also need `g++` or `clang++`, `make`,
 `cmake` and `git`.


Getting started
---------------

    export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib" (macOS only)
    mkdir build (if it doesn't already exist)
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ( or Debug if you're that type ;) )
    make -j$(nproc) (or whatever number)

### Installing manually

Windows users, just download the installer from the Releases page
 on this repository.

Install `xava` to default `/usr/local`:

    make install

Or you can change `PREFIX`, for example:

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr

If you're building from source, please don't delete the build files
 as you won't be able to uninstall xava if you do (CMake limitation).

NOTE: For MSYS2, you MUST also add ``-G"Unix Makefiles"``

### Uninstalling

    cd $where_is_xava_located/build
    xargs rm < install_manifest.txt

### Arch

XAVA is availble in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xava-git/).

    pacaur -S xava-git

### VoidLinux

XAVA is available in the Void repos:

    xbps-install xava

### Windows

There should be an installer in the Releases page of this repository.
 Just download, install and run it. Non-release builds are unstable,
 so expect breakage.

The configuration file is located in ``%appdata%\xava\config.cfg``

Technical info/notes:

Please use minGW for compilation. I haven't tested MSVC, however
 the code has a bit of GNU specific features so it may not work.

### macOS

You have to compile this yourself, get the dependencies installed
 via brew (look above) and compile it using the method described
 above.

Once you've done that, install [Background Music](https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic)
 and get it running on your Mac machine. Then, install the latest
 [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/releases/index.html) build.
 Now what you need to do is add the following into the ``[input]``
 section of the config file:
```
method = portaudio
source = "Background Music"
```
And now, within "Background Music" change the audio source of
 XAVA to the speaker output that you want recorded.

You are free to use either ``x11`` or ``sdl`` as the output methods.
Note however that ``x11`` may not work for some people.
Also, keep in mind that ``transparency = true`` DOES NOT work on macOS.


All installers/distro specific installation sources might be out of date.


Capturing audio
---------------

### From WASAPI (Windows only, super easy)

If you are on Windows, just use this.
 Don't even bother dealing with other options. 

It's enabled by default if it detects compilation for Windows
 and if it's disabled go and set ``method = win`` in the ``[input]``
 section of the config file.

If you want to record loopback audio (that is "what you hear")
 (default) set ``source = loopback`` in the ``[input]`` section
 of the config file. Otherwise you can set anything else for
 it to record from the default microphone.


### From Pulseaudio monitor source (Easy as well, unsupported on macOS and Windows)

First make sure you have installed pulseaudio dev files and
 that xava has been built with pulseaudio support (it should
 be automatically if the dev files are found).

If you're lucky all you have to do is to set this line in the
 config file under the ``[input]`` section ``method = pulse``.
 
If nothing happens you might have to use a different source
 than the default. The default might also be your microphone.
 Look at the config file for help. 


### From portaudio

First make sure you have portaudio dev files and that xava was
 built with portaudio support. Since portaudio combines the
 functionality of all audio systems, it should be the most compatible.
However, it is NOT "out of the box" because it requires some configuring.

1. To enable just set ``method = portaudio`` in the ``[input]`` section of
 your config. Afterwards change the portaudio input device, by setting
 ``source = list`` temporarily and by running xava again.

* It should list all of the available audio devices on your system
 (even that aren't input devices, watch out for that).

2. Once you find the device you want to record from,
 take it's number and set ``soruce`` to equal that number.


### From ALSA-loopback device (Tricky, unsupported on macOS and Windows)

Set ``method = alsa`` in ``[output]`` section the config file.

ALSA can be difficult because there is no native way to grab audio
 from an output. If you want to capture audio straight fom the output
 (not just mic or line-in), you must create an ALSA loopback interface,
 then output the audio simultaneously to both the loopback and your
 normal interface.

To create a loopback interface simply run:

`sudo modprobe snd_aloop`

Hopefully your `aplay -l` should now contain a loopback interface.

To make it presistent across boot add the line `snd-aloop` to
 "/etc/modules". To keep it form beeing loaded as the first
 soundcard add the line `options snd-aloop index=1`to
 "/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf", this will load it at '1'.
 You can replace '1' with whatever makes most sense in your audio setup.

Playing the audio through your Loopback interface makes it
 possible for xava to to capture it, but there will be no sound
 in your speakers. In order to play audio on the loopback interface
 and your actual interface you must make use of the ALSA multi channel.

Look at the included example file `example_files/etc/asound.conf`
 on how to use  the multi channel. I was able to make this work
 on my laptop (an Asus UX31 running Ubuntu), but I had no luck
 with the ALSA method on my Rasberry PI (Rasbian) with an USB DAC.
 The PulseAudio method however works perfectly on my PI. 

Read more about the ALSA method [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12984089/capture-playback-on-play-only-sound-card-with-alsa).

If you are having problems with the alsa method on Rasberry PI,
 try enabling `mmap` by adding the following line to `/boot/config.txt` and reboot:

```
dtoverlay=i2s-mmap
```


### From mpd's fifo output

Add these lines in mpd:

    audio_output {
        type                    "fifo"
        name                    "my_fifo"
        path                    "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
        format                  "44100:16:2"
    }

Uncomment and change input method to `fifo` in the config file.

The path of the fifo can be specified with the `source` parameter.

I had some trouble with sync (the visualizer was ahead of the sound).
 Reducing the ALSA buffer in mpd fixed it:

    audio_output {
            type            "alsa"
            name            "My ALSA"
            buffer_time     "50000"   # (50ms); default is 500000 microseconds (0.5s)
    }


### sndio

sndio is the audio framework used on OpenBSD, but it's also available on
 FreeBSD and Linux. So far this is only tested on FreeBSD.

To test it
```bash
# Start sndiod with a monitor sub-device
$ sndiod -dd -s default -m mon -s monitor

# Set the AUDIODEVICE environment variable to override the default
# sndio device and run xava
$ AUDIODEVICE=snd/0.monitor xava
```


### squeezelite

[squeezelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezelite) is one of several
 software clients available for the Logitech Media Server. Squeezelite can
 export it's audio data as shared memory, which is what this input module uses.
Configure XAVA with the `-DSHMEM=ON` (cmake) option, then adapt your config:
```
method = shmem
source = /squeezelite-AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```
where `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` is squeezelite's MAC address (check the LMS
 Web GUI (Settings>Information) if unsure).

Note: squeezelite must be started with the `-v` flag to enable visualizer support.



Latency notes
-------------

If you see latency issues, ie. visualizer not reacting on time,
 try turning off demanding graphical effects and/or shrinking the window,
 or just lower the ``fft_size`` and ``input_size`` (as increasing capture
 time creates a delay).

If your audio device has a huge buffer, you might experience that xava
 is actually ahead than the audio you hear. This reduces the experience
 of the visualization. To fix this, try decreasing the buffer settings
 in your audio playing software. Or in case of MPD, just quickly pause
 and resume playback (yes, this is a bug).

If you are getting lag spikes on Windows, please use Vsync
 as the Windows process scheduler is always inaccurate.

Usage
-----

	Usage : xava [options]
	Visualize audio input in terminal. 

	Options:
		-p	path to config file
		-v	print version

Exit by pressing Q, ESC or by closing the window ;)

### Controls

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| <kbd>up</kbd> / <kbd>down</kbd>| increase/decrease sensitivity |
| <kbd>left</kbd> / <kbd>right</kbd>| increase/decrease bar width |
| <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>s</kbd> | increase/decrease bar spacing |
| <kbd>f</kbd> | toggle fullscreen (not supported on Windows) |
| <kbd>c</kbd> / <kbd>b</kbd>| change forground/background color |
| <kbd>r</kbd> | Reload configuration |
| <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>ESC</kbd>| Quit X.A.V.A. |

Configuration
-------------

If you're running Windows and you used the installer, you'll find a ``Configure XAVA`` shortcut
in your Start Menu.

By default a configuration file is located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xava/config`, 
`$HOME/.config/xava/config` or on Windows `%APPDATA%\xava\config`


The configurations are seperated into different categories such as ``[general]`` or ``[window]`` 
which correspond with their own options.

By default the configurations are commented by a semi-colon ``;`` in front of the option. 
You'll need to change this for the configuration changes to be effective. 

### Equalizer

To change the amplitude of certain frequencies, XAVA features an equalizer
in the ``eq`` section of the config file to do so.

The equalizer works by setting an amplitude value to a incremental 
which refers to the part of the frequency spectrum.

**Examples on how the equalizer works:**

    [eq]
    1=0
    2=1
    3=0
    4=1
    5=0

![3_138](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6376571/8670183/a54a851e-29e8-11e5-9eff-346bf6ed91e0.png)

In this example the frequency spectrum is divided in 5 parts. 
You may be able to see that the 1st, 3rd and 5th parts have been totally disabled and 
you can see the result of it on the screenshot above.

    [eq]
    1=2
    2=2
    3=1
    4=1
    5=0.5

![3_139](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6376571/8670181/9db0ef50-29e8-11e5-81bc-3e2bb9892da0.png)

And in this example you can see that the lower parts (1 and 2) 
have been amplified while 5 is being lowered.

### Output modes

XAVA supports outputing as `x`, `sdl` and `win`. You can change the output
mode in the ``[general]`` section of the config file, provided that the 
feature was actaully built in.

### Basic window options

You can find these in the ``window`` section of the configuration file:

Window size:

	width = *number of pixels*
	height = *number of pixels*

Toggle fullscreen:

	fullscreen = *1 or 0*

WARNING: On ``win`` it isn't supported.

Toggle window border:

	border = *1 or 0*

### Window position

Move the window on startup to a specific part of the screen:

	alignment = 'top_left', 'top', 'top_right'. 'left', 'center', 'right', 'bottom_left', 'bottom', 'bottom_right' and by default 'none'

In addition to window aligment you can adjust the window position further with:

	x_padding = (specify value)

	y_padding = (specify value)

### Advanced window options

The following features enable options that come with recent OSes 
and may introduce problems on older software/hardware (fxp. Windows XP),
 but in return they may look really nice if you configure them properly.

You can enable transparent windows:
     
	transparency = 1

WARNING: ``sdl`` doesn't support transparency.

And with transparency comes the ability to change the opacity of the background and the bars:

	foreground_opacity = *range from 0.0 to 1.0*
	background_opacity = *range from 0.0 to 1.0*

Force the window to be behind any window (may not work):
    
	keep_below = 1

Set window properties (X11 only):

	set_win_props = 1

This changes the X11 window type so that the compositor doesn't 
apply shadows and blur onto the window. However, this is not 
guaranteed to work, plus additional breakage may occur. 

Make the window not react on mouse input (it just lets the click
 go through the window):
    
	interactable = 0

Pro-tip: You can still gain control of the window by clicking
 it's taskbar icon or by alt-tabbing into it.

### OpenGL

To run XAVA in OpenGL:

	opengl = true

WARNING: OpenGL isn't supported on ``sdl``.
And also on Windows OpenGL is always enabled, despite what you
 set it to.

### VSync

VSync is enabled by default on XAVA.

You can change it's behaviour or outright just disable it.

To do that open the configuration file and in the ``general``
 section you'll find:

	vsync = 1 (1 means its enabled)
	vsync = -1 (enable variable refresh rate)
	vsync = 0 (disable Vsync)
	vsync = 2 (custom framerate, the number is a divisor of the refresh rate of your display)

### Bars

In XAVA you can customize the look of the visualizer.

In the ``general`` section you'll find two options that let
 you change the size of the bars and the space between them:

	bar_width = *width in pixels*
	bar_spacing = *width in pixels*

To limit the number of bars displayed on the window, set the
 following in the ``general`` category:

	bars = *insert number here*

### Colors and gradients

In the ``color`` section of the config file you can find:

	background = *predefined colors in listed in the config file or a hex number in quotes*
	foreground = *same as above*

But if you want to have gradients on the bars instead of
 static colors, you can enable them by changing:

	gradient_count = *number of colors higher than 1*
	
	gradient_color_1 = *same rule as colors*
	gradient_color_2 = *same as above*
	...

### Shadow

XAVA can render shadows around the bars so to make the 
visualizer look like it's floating on your desktop.
In the ``shadow`` section you'll find these two options:

	size = *in pixels*
	color = *hex color string in the following format '#aarrggbb'*

You need to enable OpenGL for the shadows to work.

NOTE: These are still buggy as Windows rasterizes polygons 
differently to other OS-es.

### Accent colors

This is enabled by default.

Setting foreground or background color to `default` will 
make XAVA attempt to color itself after the OS theme.
But on X11 it will try to read your terminal colorscheme.

### Autostart

On Windows create a shortcut of the ``xava.exe`` 
(which is in the install directory) and copy it to 
``C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\``

On Linux/BSD (or any X11 compatible OS) just copy the
 ``assets/linux/xava.desktop`` file to ``~/.config/autostart/``. 
Unless you're on a tiling WM, in which case why are you
 even reading this.

### Additional options

XAVA still has plenty to offer, just look up all of 
the options in the config file.
